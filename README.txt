Collections.defaultdict module is used to initialise value for all keys in a dictionaries. in other word without this we are unable to increment the value of a dictionarie
In our project with have 4 pyhton files : 

The first "main.py", which is not yet in use but will be in the future.

The second "Function1.py", here we stocked every funtions that we created and that we will use for our porject and in main. List of our functions in chronological order of project instructions ( list_of_files(); lower_letter(); tf(); idf(); tf(); create_TF_IDF_matrix() )

The third "Test1.py", in that file we used it as debuger with print in order to show what we were doing in the console, And also we use it to change our files in speeches to put them in cleaned .

The fourth "Features.py", Here we put all the features and to try the features just go on the  and run the code. Then you have to chose the number of the features that you want to try (between 1 and 6)

The 2 direcoties are /Speeches and /Cleaned, the first directory contains all the original texts in lower case, and the second directory contains the files after chagement all the speeches but without the periods, punctuation, etc..., by the way after the function lower_later() all the functions are based on the second directory which is Cleaned.
