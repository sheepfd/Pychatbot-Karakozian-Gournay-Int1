In our project with have 3 pyhton files : 

The first "main.py", Here you can see the menu where you have to choice between the option 1 by inputing 1 or the option 2 byinputing 2. If you select option 1, you gain access to the seven available features. Alternatively, if you choose option 2, you can interact with the chatbot and freely ask it any questions you may have.

The second "Function1.py", here we stocked every funtions that we created and that we will use for our porject in main. All the functions are well described inside the file itself.
Furthermore, the file incorporates three modules:
The collections.defaultdict module is employed to initialize values for all keys in dictionaries. In simpler terms, it enables us to increment the value of a dictionary even if the key does not exist.
The math module is utilized for mathematical functions such as sqrt() and log10().
os.listdir() is employed to retrieve the list of all entries within a designated directory. It furnishes a list comprising the names of the entries present in the specified directory.

The third "Test1.py", in that file we used it as debuger with print in order to show what we were doing in the console, And also we use it to change our files in speeches to put them in cleaned .

The 2 direcoties are /Speeches and /Cleaned, the first directory contains all the original texts in lower case, and the second directory contains the files after chagement all the speeches but without the periods, punctuation, etc..., by the way after the function lower_later() all the functions are based on the second directory which is Cleaned.
